## Notes

Mengkutip dari blog [theresiatanzil](https://twitter.com/theresiatanzil) [proses.id](http://proses.id/journaling/)

- I am able to reflect and am more mindful of my own thought process and behaviours.
- It helps me organise my thoughts and verify some assumptions I didn’t notice before.
- My attention span grows stronger.

For me, journaling is like building my private time machine.

I can read last year’s entry and discover how much I have or haven’t changed
