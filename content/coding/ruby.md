```
x = "100".to_i
```

The dot means that message `to_i` is being sent to the string `"100"`. The string `"100"` is called the _receiver_ of the message. We can also say that the method `to_i` being _called_ on the string `"100"`. The result of method call - the integer 100 - serves as the right-hand side of the assignment to the variable `x`.

In Ruby, a method will return the result of the last evaluated statement. Explicitly using the `return` keyword is therefore unnecessary, except when returning early in a method.

For example, this will print `16` as the multiply method returns the result of `a * b`, its final expression.

```ruby
def multiple(a, b)
  a * b
end

print multiple(2, 8)
```
