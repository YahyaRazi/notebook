## Notes

> Why it's Worth Learning Go? Di kutip dari [https://rjzaworski.com/2018/09/why-its-worth-learning-go](https://rjzaworski.com/2018/09/why-its-worth-learning-go)

> But if Erlang has processes and Rust has a type system, Go’s killer feature is maintainability. On big projects, small projects, or projects actively developed by a small army of contributors, the same restrictions that can make Go feel like a chore make for software that’s unusually easy to maintain.

> Walk up to a random Go program and you’ll encounter patterns that you’ve seen in 93% of other Go programs.

> Simple syntax makes software easier to reason about, debug, and maintain.
